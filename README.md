# GravityArt
An early project involving massive clouds of particles reacting to nodes of force that either push or pull them, creating beautiful visual patterns.

Run by opening a command prompt in the root directory and typing (without quotation marks) "java -cd bin GravityArt"

The control panel in the upper right allows creating new particle clouds.

The square force nodes can be clicked and dragged to adjust their position and properties.
